Each row in these files contains a fraction of the clip that starts and ends with camera cuts. The 3 pictures are screenshots of its first frame, a middle frame, and the last frame. Note that the software detection is sometimes wrong or not what you need, so please only refer to it after you decide that a new scene starts exactly at a camera cut.
